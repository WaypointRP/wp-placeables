## Waypoint Yogamats

This is a simple addon for Waypoint Placeables that lets the player place a yoga mat on the ground and interact with the yogamat to begin doing yoga.

The player has two yoga options when interacting with the yoga mat:
- Begin a looped animation of doing yoga by pressing the `UP` arrow key
- Progress between yoga actions one at a time by pressing the `LEFT / RIGHT` arrow keys

The player can exit the yoga mat by pressing `BACKSPACE`.

You can optionally configure to apply buffs to the player while they are using a yogamat (ie: reduce stress, increase health, etc).
